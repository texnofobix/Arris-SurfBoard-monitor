## A script for monitoring Arris SurfBoard Cable Modems

I was tired of wondering if it was me or the ISP...

Hopoefully this will help.


This script scrapes the logs and can will send status messages based on the most recent log entry.



This is still a work in progress as there is no real usefull output methods.  I will most likeley wind up using this in a Sensu instance. 

Outputs will be either InfluxLine Protocol or Nagios/both
