# Arris-SurfBoard-monitor

## A script for monitoring Arris SurfBoard Cable Modems

I was tired of wondering if it was me or the ISP...

Hopoefully this will help.

This is still a work in progress as there is no real usefull output methods.  I will most likeley wind up using this in a Sensu instance. 

Outputs will be either InfluxLine Protocol or Nagios/both
